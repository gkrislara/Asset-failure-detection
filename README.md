# Asset-failure-detection
The aim is to track certain objects subjected to theft or missing. We intend to do that using the LoRaWAN communication protocol. This is because it has long distance coverage with lower bandwidth which is best suited for sending low cost messages upon a small trigger using a button or any kind of signal.
For the version 1 it has been programmed to send message through API calls from waytosms.com
It also uses location API from here.com to reverse geocode the gps coordinates.
